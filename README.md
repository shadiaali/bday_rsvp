# bday_rsvp
A birthday invitation website built with php.

## Features
- Main party info landing page
- Online rsvp form
- Back-end, password protected admin login
- Admin can view and filter rsvp responses, which are stored and pulled from database.
- Saves paper and simplifies the rsvp process. 


## Planned Features
- Might want to add edit/delete feature for rsvps, in case responses need to be edited or deleted for whatever reason. Wasn't needed for my purpose.
